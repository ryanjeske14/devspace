    bio:
      "Let's get one thing straight... there's nothing soft about my software. My programs don't have version numbers because I only write them once. My code optimizes itself. I don't use debuggers; I just stare down the bugs until the code confesses. If users report a bug or have a feature request, they don't live to see the sun set.",
